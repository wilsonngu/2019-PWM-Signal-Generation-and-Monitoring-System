# PWM-Signal-Generation-and-Monitoring-System

The objective of this System is to design, implement and create a pulse-width modulated (PWM) signal using a potentiometer (whose resistance varies between 0Ω and 5000Ω), a microcontroller, an optocoupler and an external timer. The PWM signal is monitored and its frequency is ultimately generated by an NE555 integrated circuit. The frequency and resistance is measured by the C program running on the STM32F0 Discovery Board and displayed on the HD44780U Dot Matrix LCD.
An analog to digital converter (ADC) is required to read a variable analog input voltage created by the potentiometer. The STM32F0 Discovery Board has a built-in ADC and a digital to analog converter (DAC). The following is required to successfully display the resistance and frequency of the PWM signal to the LCD: the serial peripheral interface (SPI), which includes the Serial Shift Register (SCK), Latch Clock (GPIO), and Master-Out-Slave-In (MOSI). These components allow appropriate data transfer between registers and data bits for the interaction with the 4-bit LCD.
